# AllWeather

Created for a secondary school final exam project (aka tesina) a lot of time ago.
It has been my first serious approch in the Android development world.
During time i improved the code base with new skills learned on the job but i hadn't have a lot of free time and i stopped (i hope paused) project.

### What is it AllWeather?

The special thing (at least for when it was created) was the possibilty to changed weather provider.
